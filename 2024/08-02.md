## Minutes

Web Payments meeting all day on Thursday
Interest on IP on Payments Fraud mitigations.

Ian: WPSIG has looked at Trust Tokens, but is more interested in “Same Device for this Card/Payment Instrument”.

Ian:  As tokenized cards becomes more prominent, tracking across different token cards/specific cards, this may have a different privacy story across origins. Payments identifier may be less identifying.

Ian:  Banks currently use one-time passcodes. Having context to reduce friction in future uses with an account.

Per: Focus on anti-abuse across all industries. There are types of fraud that impact everyone. User Agent reduction, IP anonymization might impact various industries across the online world.

Brian: Notion of APIs that can be dialed based could be critical.
